  <h2>Competition Rules</h2>

  <h3>Scoring</h3>

  <p>
    When the competition starts, you will have {{allottedTime}} to complete as many problems as you
    can.
  </p>
  <p>
    Participants are ranked by the most problems solved. Two participants who solve the same number
    of problems are ranked first by least total time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved.
    The time consumed for a problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the competition to the
    submittal of the first correct submission, plus any necessary penalties (see below). There is no
    time consumed for an unsolved problem.
  </p>
  <h4>Penalties</h4>
  <p>
    Some problems may incur a time penalty, meaning that each incorrect submission will decrease the
    worth of a correct submission by adding the designated penalty to the total time for that
    problem.
